\section{ Model }

We consider the space-time normalized model of two dissipatively coupled van der Pol (vdP) oscillators given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:system}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \ddot x  - ( 1 - x^2 ) \dot x + ( 1 - \dw ) x + \mu_1 ( \dot x - \dot y ) = 0       \\
        &  \ddot y  - ( 1 - y^2 ) \dot y + ( 1 + \dw ) y + \mu_2 ( \dot y - \dot x ) = 0  
    \end{aligned},
\end{equation}
where \( 0 < \dw < 1 \) is a \emph{ normalized relative frequency difference } and \( \mu_i \le 0 \) describe couplings\todo{in case it might be useful, lets set \(  \mu_1 + \mu_2 = 2 \mu \) and \( | \mu_1 - \mu_2 | = 2 \Delta \mu \)}. Note that \( x \) is set to be a ``faster'' of two oscillators and one should consider different setups in terms of which oscillator (the ``fast'' one or the ``slow'' one ) has larger coupling.

Notable cases:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep = -0.25em, topsep = -0.5em]
      \item[(i)] \emph{ symmetric coupling }, \( \mu_1 = \mu_2 \), previously studied and should be used as reference point; 
      \item[(ii)] \emph{fancy RHS}, e.g. \( \mu_2 = 0 \), so 
      \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                  & \ddot x  - ( 1 - \mu_1 - x^2 ) \dot x + ( 1 - \dw ) x = \mu_1 \dot y     \\
                  &  \ddot y  - ( 1 - y^2 ) \dot y + ( 1 + \dw ) y   = 0  
              \end{aligned} 
      \end{equation}
      which mimic a case of vdP with a ``resonant'' RHS\todo{it is not really a resonance, since the amplitude on the right correspond to some function a frequency on the left, but \emph{maybe}\dots}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}[Half-sum/half-diff notation]
      On par with the previous papers, we provide the same dynamics as in \Cref{eq:system} under the following change of variables:
      \begin{equation}
            \begin{cases}
                  2u = x + y \\
                  2v = x - y 
            \end{cases}
            \qquad 
            \begin{cases}
                  x = u + v \\
                  y = u - v
            \end{cases},
      \end{equation}
      so we obtain
      \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:uv}
            \begin{aligned}
                  & \ddot u - ( 1 - u^2 - v^2 ) \dot u + u - \dw v + 2 u v \dot v + \textcolor{rwth-red}{ 2 \Delta\mu \dot v  } = 0 \\
                  & \ddot v - ( 1 - u^2 - v^2 ) \dot v + v - \dw u + 2 v u \dot u + 2 \mu \dot v = 0 
            \end{aligned}
      \end{equation}
      with the highlighted term concentrates the asymmetry of the coupling.
\end{remark}

\section{ Synchronization }

All of our consideration and defined entities are well-posed only for synchronized pair of oscillators. Specifically, one normally distinguishes two types of synchronization, in \emph{ frequency } and \emph{ phase }. Recall that in the case of symmetric coupling \( \mu_1 = \mu_2 \), the synchronization seemed to be joint, i.e. frequency synchronization necessarily implied phase synchronization and vice versa\todo{it is worth revisiting it around the threshold, we haven't properly tested it in the ``battle'' region}.

\begin{remark}[Synchronization inequality from simpler times]\label{rem:kuramoto_synch}
      Under specific simplifying assumptions, one may reduce symmetrically coupled vdP system ( \Cref{eq:system} ) to a simple Kuramoto model where the synchronization is achieved if and only if \( \mu > \dw \); previously, we inherited that property for the symmetric vdP system which seeemed to hold experimentally.
      \\[5pt]

      At the same time, in the nonsymmetric Kuramoto case, assuming initial frequencies \( \Omega_1 \) and \( \Omega_2 \), the system is synchronized if \[ \mu_1 > \Omega_1 - \Omega_0  \text{ and } \mu_2 > \Omega_2 - \Omega_0 \] where \( \Omega_0 \) is the common synchronized frequency, \( \Omega_0 = \frac{ \mu_1 \Omega_1 + \mu_2 \Omega_2 }{ \mu_1 + \mu_2 } \). Note that this principle may be expected to largely translate to the vdP case with certain caveats; specifically, it is challenging to redefine \( \Omega_0 \) since even for \( \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu \) the common frequency was shown to be dependent on \( \mu \), \( \Omega_0 = \Omega_0 ( \mu ) \), albeit this dependence is rather small.
\end{remark}
\todo{probably worth recalling some series expansions here}.


\subsection{Barcode diagrams}

Here we formulate a straightforward method to test the synchronization of two oscillators, \Cref{eq:system}. 

We base our estimates on the relative placement of local minima of \( \{ x(t), y(t) \} \); namely,
\begin{enumerate}[ topsep = -0.5em, itemsep = -0.25em ]
      \item[\color{rwth-blue}(i)] solve the system (\eqref{eq:system}) for long-enough time (specifically, we solve for \( [ 0; T ] = [ 0; 2 \pi N ]\), \( N = 100 \) ); this length is based on the notion that the first order approximation of the isolated vdP frequency is \( 1 \), so the first order period is \( 2 \pi \) \todo{ here a reference for the series decomposition should be };
      \item[\color{rwth-blue}(ii)] for each oscillator \( \{ x(t), y(t) \} \) we extract position of local minima \( \{ \tau_x^{(i)} \}\) and \( \{ \tau_y^{(i)} \}\)  \todo{one can do this with preexisting tools, but the fact is that ODEsolver computes an approximation of \( \dot x \) and \( \dot y \), so one can extract minima from them};
      \item[\color{rwth-blue}(iii)] then one can define \textit{empirical} frequencies as \( \left\{ \Omega_x^{(i)} \right\} = \left\{ \frac{1}{ \tau_x^{(i+1)} - \tau_x^{(i)} } \right\} \) and \( \left\{ \Omega_y^{(i)} \right\} = \left\{ \frac{1}{ \tau_y^{(i+1)} - \tau_y^{(i)} } \right\} \) respectively; we measure the standard deviation of the frequency sequences \( \left\{ \Omega_x^{(i)} \right\} \) over the last \( 20 \) minima (relative to the mean value) to ascertain synchronization;
      \item[\color{rwth-blue}(iv)] finally, we posit that the phase difference \( \Delta\varphi \) never exceeds half a period, so in order to calculate it, we find for each minimum \( \tau_x^{(i)} \) the closest minimum \( \tau_y^{(j)} \); then, we say that \( \Delta\phi^{(i)} = \left| \tau_x^{(i)} - \tau_y^{(j)} \right| \) and compute the stability of the sequence in the same manner. 
\end{enumerate}

      }
\end{figure}

We provide the stabilization of frequency and the phase difference in \Cref{fig:synch_heatmap}. It is worth pointing out that:
\begin{itemize}[ topsep = -0.5em, itemsep = -0.25em ]
      \item point \( \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \dw \) lends on the boundary, upholding observed behaviour in the symmetric case;
      \item in the case of \( \mu_1 = 0 \), Kuramoto synchronization (see \Cref{rem:kuramoto_synch}) requires \( \mu_2 \ge \dw \) (and vice versa), which is evidently too restrictive for the vdP case;
      \item phase and frequency synchronizations remain joint and are achieved simultaneously;
      \item the boundary is impressively pronounced, so one may at least attempt to speculate about the actual function and synchronization inequality.
